We don't want spam bots to control our forms!

**CuCa Validator** comes to prevent spam to overflow into your site, using nicely designed captchas modules.
Choose between the skins built in and have CuCa fit into your theme. Or if you don't want any module at all,
just set up your captcha your way.

Each captcha module is handled by a **shortcode** and can easily be added into any post/page.
Set up the captcha difficulty from the admin page.

**CuCa Validator** stops spams the nice way, and maximize user experience.



**CuCa Math Validator** Makes you solve a simple math operation to validate the form and let you continue your navigation.

**CuCa Word Validator** (Work in progress) - Makes you solve a standar alphanumeric captcha like the ones you're used to.
